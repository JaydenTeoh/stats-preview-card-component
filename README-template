## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

I learnt to create my first website using basic HTML/CSS. 

Some new code I learnt:

*{
box-sizing: border- box
}
border-box tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. 

.container .image-header{
    background: url(./images/image-header-mobile.jpg) no-repeat center/cover;
}
I learnt to create an image in CSS. Usually, I would have created it in the HTML img element. Still not very sure what no-repeat and center/cover does.
### Continued development

With this project, I am confident to take on other projects on Frontend Mentor.
